## Clinical Nutrition Education & Tools – Project Philosophy

This project exists to explain clinical nutrition concepts clearly and to provide interactive tools that **support**, but never replace, human clinical reasoning and judgment.

- **Education first, tools second** – content and tools are designed primarily as learning aids.
- **Session-based inputs** – no persistent patient identifiers; tools operate on transient, session-only data.
- **Serverless-first** – all features should be compatible with Vercel’s serverless and edge runtimes.
- **Fast and simple** – favor lightweight UIs, minimal state, and low complexity in flows.
- **Advisory-only language** – outputs are framed as estimates, examples, or discussion prompts, not orders or prescriptions.
- **Safety disclaimers everywhere** – clear boundaries and warnings accompany all tools and clinical-sounding content.
